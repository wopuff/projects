                <p>
                    We plan to transform the overdecking into a place where people can meet up and socialize. 
                    We want to move away from the industrial feeling of a large concrete block in the middle of the highway. 
                    Achieving this required a lot of creative brainstorming and planning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we ourselves live or spend a lot of time in Nacka, this project means a lot to us. 
                    The decisions will affect us, as well as everyone living in Nacka, so we prioritize that this is done correctly. 
                    You can read more about what we plan to do with the area in <a href="our-plans.html">Our plans</a>.

        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of students from Nacka Gymnasium who have been tasked with 
            developing a park during our technology classes. 
            Everyone has worked on the project model, alongside the written part of the assignment. 
            Since the group members pursue different technology specializations, 
            we specialize in different areas, which is excellent for obtaining a versatile workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
            We chose this area because it offers great freedom. 
            The overhang will be completely empty &#8211; a large, open space with lots of possibilities. 
            We will need to use a lot of creativity.
