            1. Choose the difficulty in the menu. It's recommended to
            start with the easy mode and work your way up.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Remember that you always can go back to the menu by clicking 
            "Memory" at the top.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Click a tile to flip it and reveal its image on the other side.
            The goal is to click two tiles in a row, with the same image. If you
            don't, the two tiles will turn back and you'll have to remember
            their images.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. The goal is to use as few turns as possible. Your stats will be 
            shown at the end of the game. Good luck!
